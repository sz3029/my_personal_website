## Hello, I'm Shihui (Shirley) Zhu, 祝诗慧!

Welcome to my personal website :stuck_out_tongue: 

I'm a data scientist in the [AstraZeneca R&D graduate program](https://careers.astrazeneca.com/data-sciences-and-ai-graduate-programme), currently based in Gaithersburg, MD, U.S., with two years of experience driving innovation at the intersection of data science and healthcare. I have a strong passion for harnessing data-driven solutions to advance medical research and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

My expertise spans statistical analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applied to real-world, biological, imaging, and clinical datasets. I have led and delivered innovative projects, including the deployment of GenAI models across therapeutic areas such as respiratory disease and oncology. I am skilled in Python, R, SQL, and AWS, and excel at collaborating within cross-functional teams to translate complex methodologies into actionable, impactful insights.

Originally from Beijing, China, I pursued my higher education in the U.S., making me fluent in both Mandarin and English. Outside of work, I enjoy reading detective novels, swimming, and spending quality time with friends. I am actively exploring career opportunities in Beijing, Shanghai, or the U.S.—if my background interested with you, please feel free to get in touch :)
