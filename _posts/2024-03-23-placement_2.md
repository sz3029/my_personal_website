A proof-of-concept (PofC) chatbot using agentic AI and AWS to accelerate clinical trial protocol document workflows

### Tools & Techniques
Python (`LangChain`/`LangGraph`), AWS Bedrock Agent, AWS Sagemaker, AWS Sandbox, FastAPI, GitHub

### Summary

Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is present in roughly half of patients with advanced ovarian cancer (OV), but genetic testing (GT) to determine HRD status has had limited and inequitable reach to patients in the United States, resulting in suboptimal access to PARPi treatment for those patients. 

In this project, we have explored the use of computational pathology, utilizing advances in whole slide imaging (WSI) and AI/Machine learning, to predict molecular status from images of the H&E-stained biopsies for OV patients. A weakly-supervised deep learning model, CLAM, was utilized to link image-derived information to HRD status and aggregate slide-level predictions without the need for manual image annotations or user-selected regions of interest. Pre-trained vision-transformers were used to generated tile-level information. A multimodal approach (attention scores combining with patient age, GIS scores, etc.) was also evaluated. 

The model was trained and tested on a small commercial cohort of 675 ovarian cancer tissue WSIs and has yielded promising results: ROC AUC score of HRD+ prediction on unseen patients acheived 72% (95% CI is [63%, 81%]), with high sensitivity (0.8) and increased PPV (> 23%) We also find that models trained on hetergrneous slides performed better on prediction task. These findings would potentially improve the prioritization of patients with a higher likelihood of HRD for GT at the pre-screening stage. Manuscript is finished and we are waiting for submission approval.
