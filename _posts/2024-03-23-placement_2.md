A proof-of-concept (PofC) chatbot using agentic AI and AWS to accelerate clinical trial protocol document workflows

### Tools & Techniques
Python (`LangChain`/`LangGraph`, `pymupdf`), AWS Bedrock Agent, AWS Sagemaker, AWS Sandbox, `FastAPI`, GitHub

### Summary

Clinical study protocols (CSPs) are essential for maintaining both the integrity and scientific validity of clinical trials. Examples can be found [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/). However, CSP development is often a complex and time-intensive process for pharmacetical companies: it requires deep disease-specific expertise for accurate trial design, aligning with best practices established in previous trials, and consistency with organizational standards and regulatory requirements. 

Currently, using general chat applications like ChatGPT to extract and summarize clinical study protocols poses significant challenges: they lack domain-specific training, often miss critical regulatory and contextual nuances, and struggle with diverse document formats and data types. As a result, the extracted information can be incomplete, non-reproducible, or misleading.

To streamline the handling of unstructured CSP documents and improve the quality of information extraction and summarization, I explored AI-assisted ETL processes leveraging advanced techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), foundation models, and AI agents. To ensure accessibility and ease of use, I deployed a conversational AI chatbot capable of performing these tasks interactively. This approach is designed to support statisticians in accelerating the development of high-quality clinical trial protocols.

#### CSP document digitalization

Tasks include: loading unstructured PDF to structured vectordatase, extraction of primary objective, endpoints, assessments/flowchart (tables) and basic trial information extraction, clinical assessment ontologies mapping, etc.

#### AI Agent Development

Utilized RAG framework (via `LangChain` and `LangGraph` Graph API), and FastAPI as interactive API server. The RAG was integrated with a LLM model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) via AWS bedrock agent, enabling the generation of responses to user queries while providing relevant references if needed.

### Demo (Simplified Version)

**Primary Notice:** The original chatbot was deployed using company-hosted cloud services. This simplified version is designed for local deployment and operates independently, without relying on AWS infrastructure.
