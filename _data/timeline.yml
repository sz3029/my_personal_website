    **Key Responsibilities & Achievements**
      - Elevated HRD prediction accuracy among ovarian cancer patients by 23% PPV using pre-screening biopsies
      - Developed a **reusable python program** for **model training, validation, and testing** for user-defined imaging data—including cross-validation, metrics computation, and visualization (ROC AUC, PR curves, and attention heatmaps)—using `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`/`seaborn`, and `PIL`
      - **Led and organized** team meetings with pathologists and data scientists to refine the design and the interpretability of the PofC AI-driven diagnostic tools
      - Contributed to an open-source Python package (`slideflow`) by modifying the processing pipeline and implementing a customizable feature extractor class through Pytorch, used `git` version control to track progress
      - Presented work at the **2024 AstraZeneca Data Science Symposium**, **2024 Graduate Program Symposium**, finished the manuscript and is working on publication approval, codes available for review on company GitHub
    
    **Placement No. 2**: Developed a proof-of-concept chatbot utilizing agentic AI, RAG and LLMs to improve clinical trial efficiency (Tech:  Python (`LangChain`/`LangGraph`), AWS Bedrock, AWS Sagemaker, AWS Sandbox, FastAPI, GitHub)

    **Key Responsibilities & Achievements**
      -	Evaluated and benchmarked of State-of-the-Art LLMs on **AWS Bedrock** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** components for **unstructured** clinical protocols (CSPs), informing product pipeline architecture to meet both technical and business requirements
      -	Architected and deployed a proof-of-concept, LLM-powered **chatbot** using AWS Bedrock agent (e.g. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Titan's Embedding), `LangChain`, and `LangGraph`, running via `FAST API`, enabling customized clinical trial protocol development enabling unstructured documents digitalization, objectives, endpoints, assessment table etc. extractions
      -	Developed and integrated **LLM-based evaluation metrics** (precision, recall, answer accuracy, hallucination) using Graph API via `LangGraph` to ensure robust model performance and reliability
      -	Designed and implemented a simple RAG system for automatic mapping of **clinical assessment ontology**, leveraging Text Embedding models, achieved greater than 70% `precision@1`
      -	Collaborated effectively in an **Agile** environment with a global team, utilizing **Jira** for sprint planning and issue tracking, ensuring efficient project execution and delivery
      - Presented work at digital health department data science group meeting and 2024 Graduate Program Symposium

    **Placement No. 3**: Drafted a study protocol and performed statistical analysis using real-world data (RWD) of claims records and EHR data to inform clinical trial designs in Early R&I (Tech: R (`ggplot2`), PostgreSQL, AWS Redshift)

    **Key Responsibilities & Achievements**
      -	Independently authored a **study protocol** and **statistical analysis plan (SAP)** for a retrospective, observational **real-world data** (OPTUM claims data), investigating **multimorbidity** in patients with asthma, COPD and bronchiectasis 
      -	Designed a data processing and analysis pipeline using **`SQL`** queries on **Amazon RedShift** and wrapped with **reusable R functions**, enabling accurate **cohort definition, statistical and epidemiological analysis**, tracked changes via Git
      -	Providing key insights using **boxplots, Sankey plots** etc., generated using `ggplot2` visualization, provide important numbers for clinical trial decisions in early R&I for respiratory diseases
      -	Currently conducting a **parallel analysis** on TriNetX (EHR) data to inform study development across respiratory diseases and validate the harmonization across data, using the established study protocol and SAP as guide for analysis, ensuring methodological consistency
